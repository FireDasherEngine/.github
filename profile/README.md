FireDasherEngine is an open-source 3D game engine developed by FireDasher22.

If you want to contribute then contribute and create a pull request, but if you want to become a developer then add an issue on [FireDasherEngine/FireDasherEngine](https://github.com/FireDasherEngine/FireDasherEngine/) and you might become a developer if you're worthy.

Also if you are good at graphic design then you can make the icon for FireDasherEngine because I am terrible at graphics design, as you can see.
